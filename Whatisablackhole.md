#            What is a **black hole**？

——Black holes are points in space that are so dense they create deep gravity sinks. Beyond a certain region, not even light can escape the powerful tug of a black hole's gravity. And anything that ventures too close—be it star, planet, or spacecraft—will be stretched and compressed like putty in a theoretical process aptly known as spaghettification.

——There are four types of black holes: <u>stellar</u>, <u>intermediate</u>, <u>supermassive</u>, and <u>miniature</u>. The most commonly known way a black hole forms is by stellar death. As stars reach the ends of their lives, most will inflate, lose mass, and then cool to form white dwarfs. But the largest of these fiery bodies, those at least 10 to 20 times as massive as our own sun, are destined to become either super-dense <u>neutron stars</u> or so-called stellar-mass black holes.
